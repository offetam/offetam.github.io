# Ideas for dataset

-   Avg. salary of various NFL players by positions
    -   A line graph showing the change over 2011 to 2018.
-   Box plot of salary for each position over the years
-   Then perhaps after, figure out if I can learn to make the graphs dynamic by letting user compare

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

nfl_salary <- read.csv("datasets/nfl_salary.csv")
head(nfl_salary)

```
