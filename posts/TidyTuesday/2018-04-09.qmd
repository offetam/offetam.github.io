You can find the dataset I used for this week [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2018/2018-04-09/nfl_salary.xlsx) (2018-04-09).

# Ideas for dataset

-   Avg. salary of various NFL players by positions
    -   A line graph showing the change over 2011 to 2018.
-   Box plot of salary for each position over the years
-   Then perhaps after, figure out if I can learn to make the graphs dynamic by letting user compare

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

nfl_salary <- read.csv("datasets/nfl_salary.csv")
head(nfl_salary)

```

# Visualization 1
Let's try to find the avg. salary for a quarterback in 2011, then per year in a line graph:

```{r}

#filter by year 2011, then by quarterback
nfl_salary_2011 <- nfl_salary |>  
  filter(year == 2011) |> 
  select(Quarterback)
nfl_salary_2011

avg_qb_salary_2011 <- nfl_salary_2011 |> 
  summarise(mean_qb_salary_2011 = mean(Quarterback, na.rm = TRUE)) #remove the NA entries otherwise mean is NA.

avg_qb_salary_2011
```
Here I filtered the rows to only be from the year 2011 and then selected the quarterback column. It's sort of implied that I took the 2011 row from filtering it earlier.

Then I used summarize to create the column that is the mean of qb salary in 2011!
