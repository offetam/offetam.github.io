    "text": "Note that the date following the post title is from when the dataset was added to Tidy Tuesday.\n\nThings you could do with this kind of data:\n\nHave a US country chart with the cost of tuition scaled by color (source has already done this, so it would be a good learning experience)\n\nThis could also be interactive to see by year if possible\n\nCompare the table with collegeboard data (which had more recent data as well)\n\nCollegeboard has data that also has tables adjusted for inflation (as of 2023) which is really cool\nI think it could be an interesting conversion to also make for the tidy tuesday dataset, since we don’t have that (use a line graph for this maybe?)\n\nInteractive table/viz comparing states with each other\nLine graph also comparing states (interactive); 50 states would be too much maybe?\n\nNext, I should decide which are simpler graphs for me to do.\nImported the data below and created my first visualization:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(usmap)\n\n\navg_us_tuition &lt;- read.csv(\"datasets/us_avg_tuition.csv\")\n\n#reamed column from \"State\" to \"state\" as usmaps won't recognize the column otherwise.\navg_us_tuition &lt;- avg_us_tuition |&gt; \n  rename(state = \"State\")\n\nhead(avg_us_tuition)\n\n       state X2004.05 X2005.06 X2006.07 X2007.08 X2008.09 X2009.10 X2010.11\n1    Alabama   $5,683   $5,841   $5,753   $6,008   $6,475   $7,189   $8,071\n2     Alaska   $4,328   $4,633   $4,919   $5,070   $5,075   $5,455   $5,759\n3    Arizona   $5,138   $5,416   $5,481   $5,682   $6,058   $7,263   $8,840\n4   Arkansas   $5,772   $6,082   $6,232   $6,415   $6,417   $6,627   $6,901\n5 California   $5,286   $5,528   $5,335   $5,672   $5,898   $7,259   $8,194\n6   Colorado   $4,704   $5,407   $5,596   $6,227   $6,284   $6,948   $7,748\n  X2011.12 X2012.13 X2013.14 X2014.15 X2015.16\n1   $8,452   $9,098   $9,359   $9,496   $9,751\n2   $5,762   $6,026   $6,012   $6,149   $6,571\n3   $9,967  $10,134  $10,296  $10,414  $10,646\n4   $7,029   $7,287   $7,408   $7,606   $7,867\n5   $9,436   $9,361   $9,274   $9,187   $9,270\n6   $8,316   $8,793   $9,293   $9,299   $9,748\n\nplot_usmap(data = avg_us_tuition, values = \"X2004.05\") + \n  labs(title = \"US Tuitions by State in 2004-2005\", subtitle = \"This data is from the tidy tuesday dataset which consists of multiple years (2004 all the way to 2015.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome takeaways after learning to plot a US Map graph:\n\nThe package usmap, is very handy for visualizations referencing states and comes with ggplot2 functionality (allowing you to use ggplot functions).\nThe package requires a “state” column (case sensitive) in order to recognize a dataframe and build off of it.\nCurrently the visualization isn’t great because each state has its own specific key. Additionally, the colors are not consistent.\n\nNext steps:\nNext, I should set a proper color scale for the various tuition costs to make the graph a lot cleaner."
