    "text": "Note that the date following the post title is from when the dataset was added to Tidy Tuesday.\n\nImported the data below:\n\navg_us_tuition &lt;- read.csv(\"datasets/us_avg_tuition.csv\")\nhead(avg_us_tuition)\n\n       State X2004.05 X2005.06 X2006.07 X2007.08 X2008.09 X2009.10 X2010.11\n1    Alabama   $5,683   $5,841   $5,753   $6,008   $6,475   $7,189   $8,071\n2     Alaska   $4,328   $4,633   $4,919   $5,070   $5,075   $5,455   $5,759\n3    Arizona   $5,138   $5,416   $5,481   $5,682   $6,058   $7,263   $8,840\n4   Arkansas   $5,772   $6,082   $6,232   $6,415   $6,417   $6,627   $6,901\n5 California   $5,286   $5,528   $5,335   $5,672   $5,898   $7,259   $8,194\n6   Colorado   $4,704   $5,407   $5,596   $6,227   $6,284   $6,948   $7,748\n  X2011.12 X2012.13 X2013.14 X2014.15 X2015.16\n1   $8,452   $9,098   $9,359   $9,496   $9,751\n2   $5,762   $6,026   $6,012   $6,149   $6,571\n3   $9,967  $10,134  $10,296  $10,414  $10,646\n4   $7,029   $7,287   $7,408   $7,606   $7,867\n5   $9,436   $9,361   $9,274   $9,187   $9,270\n6   $8,316   $8,793   $9,293   $9,299   $9,748\n\n\nThings you could do with this kind of data:\n\nHave a US country chart with the cost of tuition scaled by color (source has done this)\n\nThis could also be interactive to see by year if possible\n\nCompare the table with collegeboard data (which had more recent data as well)\n\nCollegeboard has data that also has tables adjusted for inflation (as of 2023) which is really cool\nI think it could be an interesting conversion to also make for the tidy tuesday dataset, since we don’t have that (use a line graph for this maybe?)\n\nInteractive table/viz comparing states with each other\nLine graph also comparing states (interactive); 50 states would be too much maybe?\n\nNext, I should decide which are simpler graphs for me to do."
