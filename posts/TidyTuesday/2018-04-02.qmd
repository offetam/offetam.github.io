*Note that the date following the post title is from when the dataset was added to* [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).

Things you could do with this kind of data:

-   Have a US country chart with the cost of tuition scaled by color (source has already done this, so it would be a good learning experience)
    -   This could also be interactive to see by year if possible
-   Compare the table with collegeboard data (which had more recent data as well)
    -   Collegeboard has data that also has tables adjusted for inflation (as of 2023) which is really cool
    -   I think it could be an interesting conversion to also make for the tidy tuesday dataset, since we don't have that (use a line graph for this maybe?)
-   Interactive table/viz comparing states with each other
-   Line graph also comparing states (interactive); 50 states would be too much maybe?

Next, I should decide which are simpler graphs for me to do.

Imported the data below and created my first visualization:

```{r}
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(usmap)


avg_us_tuition <- read.csv("datasets/us_avg_tuition.csv")

#reamed column from "State" to "state" as usmaps won't recognize the column otherwise.
avg_us_tuition <- avg_us_tuition |> 
  rename(state = "State")

head(avg_us_tuition)

plot_usmap(data = avg_us_tuition, values = "X2004.05") + 
  labs(title = "US Tuitions by State in 2004-2005", subtitle = "This data is from the tidy tuesday dataset which consists of multiple years (2004 all the way to 2015.") + 
  scale_color_continuous(type = "gradient")
```

Some takeaways after learning to plot a US Map graph:

1.  The package `usmap`, is very handy for visualizations referencing states and comes with ggplot2 functionality (allowing you to use ggplot functions).
2.  The package requires a "state" column (case sensitive) in order to recognize a dataframe and build off of it.
3.  Currently the visualization isn't great because each state has its own specific key. Additionally, the colors are not consistent.

Next steps: \
Next, I should set a proper color scale for the various tuition costs to make the graph a lot cleaner.
