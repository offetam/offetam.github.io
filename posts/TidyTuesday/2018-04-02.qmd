*Note that the date following the post title is from when the dataset was added to* [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday).

![](..\images\college-library.jpg)

Imported the data below:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)


avg_us_tuition <- read.csv("datasets/us_avg_tuition.csv")
head(avg_us_tuition)
```

Things you could do with this kind of data:

-   Have a US country chart with the cost of tuition scaled by color (source has done this)
    -   This could also be interactive to see by year if possible
-   Compare the table with collegeboard data (which had more recent data as well)
    -   Collegeboard has data that also has tables adjusted for inflation (as of 2023) which is really cool
    -   I think it could be an interesting conversion to also make for the tidy tuesday dataset, since we don't have that (use a line graph for this maybe?)
-   Interactive table/viz comparing states with each other
-   Line graph also comparing states (interactive); 50 states would be too much maybe?

Next, I should decide which are simpler graphs for me to do.
